//issue: how do we save data locally from the chrome extension?
    //seems to only store data to localStorage
        //can we access it from the outside?
        //the ide plugin can take it and save elsewhere to make it more stable

//task: add dropdown box to the options clicky thing to allow the user manage labels
    //create, name, set color, delete, display order
